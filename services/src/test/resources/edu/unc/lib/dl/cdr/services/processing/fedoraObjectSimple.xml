						<mods:abstract>Northwest North Carolina is experiencing an
							economic shock due to dependence on manufacturing and textile
							industries that are moving abroad. Many of the displaced workers
							entered the workforce at an early age and are now underprepared
							for work in the information economy. The institution of the
							chamber of commerce has the potential to organize businesses
							through collective efficiency, which includes joint action. By
							placing a value on place and community rather than the individual
							entity, the chamber of commerce can lead an area to recover
							through structural change of the local economy. The Mount Airy
							Chamber of Commerce is taking steps to address the economic shock
							in the area. Through participation in the Northwest North
							Carolina Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy, the chamber
							is taking an active role in promoting joint action among local
							industries. A demographic shift during the 1990s introduced a
							Latino population to Mount Airy and Surry County. A stagnant
							local population and the national demographic, political and
							economic expansion of the Latino community are reasons to believe
							that the Latino community in Mount Airy will be a significant
							factor in the future of the local economy. This study
							investigates how the Mount Airy Chamber of Commerce can
							incorporate Latino businesses in the area. The study has two
							phases. The first is a survey of all local businesses in Mount
							Airy. The survey inquires about Minority-owned businesses,
							chamber membership, familiarity with workforce training options,
							and specific workforce training needs. The second phase consists
							of interviews with Latino businesses in Mount Airy, chambers of
							commerce that deal directly with Latino populations and business
							training institutions that work with Latinos. This report
							concludes that the Mount Airy Chamber of Commerce should initiate
							an effort to coordinate with the Latino businesses. This can be
							accomplished through simple acts such as scheduling meetings at
							hours convenient for retail businesses and providing translations
							in Spanish of important legal documents. The chamber should also
							continue to support the minority council in order to demonstrate
							inclusiveness to minority businesses, rather than latently
							encouraging them to join specific minority-based chambers. Acts
							of inclusiveness and response to minority business needs are
							critical towards establishing and maintaining a unified
							commercial and industrial base in the community. These attitudes
							and actions are essential for joint action, collective
							efficiency, and economic recovery.</mods:abstract>
